        <h1>Falcons </h1>
        <p>Falcons are raptors, or birds of prey, with sharp talons on their feet, and sharp curved beaks. They are incredibly skilled predators on the wing, and their narrow wings enable them to maneuver perfectly in the air. There are approximately 40 different species of these birds, all in the taxonomic genus Falco. Their closest relatives are the caracaras.</p>

        <p>   Hereâ€™s a wild update from the skies: scientists recently tracked a peregrine falcon reaching a jaw-dropping speed of 240 mph (386 km/h) during a hunting diveâ€”making it the fastest recorded animal movement ever. This incredible feat was captured using ultra-lightweight GPS trackers and high-speed cameras, giving researchers new insight into the birdâ€™s aerodynamic mastery.

           And in a heartwarming twist, a peregrine falcon chick just hatched at St Albans Cathedral in the UK after the parentsâ€™ first clutch of eggs was destroyed by a vandal. The resilient falcon pair, named Alban and Boudica, laid a second clutch and are now proudly tending to their fluffy new arrival.
